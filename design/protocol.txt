Communications are generally query-response. Acknowledgements are given by the server before client makes new requests.

Communicated data are space-separated arguments. Exceptions are:
	quotes: "This is all one thing" and "He said ""I can use double quotes"" when escaping"
	hashes: #41 This is a dump of data so many bytes long
Command and argument sets are separated by linefeeds. Carriage returns not part of arguments are ignored.

Notation:
	Indentation represents branches in conversation tree.
	(again x) means go back to the start of the indentation x levels up (0 means same level)
